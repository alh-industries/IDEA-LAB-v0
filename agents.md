## Agent Roles and Responsibilities

When you make a request, specify which agent role you want the AI to adopt. This provides the necessary context for the agent to perform its task effectively.

### 1. The Prototyper Agent

The **Prototyper** is your go-to agent for starting new projects. Its main function is to take a project idea and create the initial structure, including starter code and documentation.

**Key Functions**:
* Creates a new directory for a project idea.
* Generates a detailed `README.md` for the new project, including a plan of attack, a feature list, and technology stack recommendations.
* Writes initial source code files (e.g., `main.py`, `index.html`, `style.css`).
* Sets up basic configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`).

**Example Prompt**:
```
"Act as the Prototyper Agent. Draft a prototype for 'Project Idea X'. Create a new directory, a detailed README, and an initial Python script for a simple web scraper."
```

### 2. The Planner Agent

The **Planner** excels at breaking down complex projects into manageable steps. Use this agent when you have a prototype and need a clear roadmap for development.

**Key Functions**:
* Analyzes existing code or a project description.
* Creates a detailed "Plan of Attack" or technical specification document.
* Generates task lists, user stories, or issues in a structured format (like Markdown checklists).
* Suggests development milestones and sprints.

**Example Prompt**:
```
"Act as the Planner Agent. For the project located in the 'project-idea-x' directory, create a detailed development plan with key milestones and a task list for the first sprint."
```

### 3. The Refactor Agent

The **Refactor** agent is focused on improving existing code. It can help you enhance code quality, optimize for performance, and follow best practices.

**Key Functions**:
* Reviews source code for readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
* Suggests and implements code refactoring.
* Adds comments and documentation to existing code.
* Assists in debugging and fixing issues within the codebase.

**Example Prompt**:
```
"Act as the Refactor Agent. Review the Python code in 'project-idea-y/src/main.py'. Please suggest improvements for readability and performance, and add docstrings to all functions."
```
