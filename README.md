# IDEA-LAB-v0

# Project Idea Incubator ðŸš€

Welcome to our project incubator! This repository is a living list of all our project ideas. The goal is to capture every idea and provide a simple way to kickstart development using AI agents.

## How It Works

The workflow is straightforward:

1.  **Add an Idea**: Add your new project idea to the list below.
2.  **Engage an Agent**: Use an AI agent to process an idea from the list.
3.  **Create a Project**: The agent will create a dedicated directory for the project.
4.  **Generate a Prototype**: The agent will generate a prototype within the new directory, which could be a detailed plan, a `README`, or even starter code.

## Project Ideas

* **[Project Idea 1]**: A brief, one-sentence description of the project.
* **[Project Idea 2]**: A brief, one-sentence description of the project.
* **[Project Idea 3]**: A brief, one-sentence description of the project.
* *(Add your new project ideas here!)*

## Getting Started

To begin working on an idea, you'll direct an AI agent to this repository.

### Example Prompt

You can use a prompt like this to instruct the agent:

```
"Please draft a prototype and a detailed README for 'Project Idea 1' from the list. Create a new directory for it named 'project-idea-1'."
```

The agent will then perform the following steps:
1.  Parse the `README.md` to find the project idea.
2.  Create a new folder named `project-idea-1/` at the root of the repository.
3.  Generate the requested prototype files inside the new folder.

For more information about the different types of agents and what they can do, please refer to the `agents.md` file.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to keep projects separate and easy to find.

```
